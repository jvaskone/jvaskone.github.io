            <p>Hi, my name is Judit and I hold a Master&#8217;s degree in computer science (University of Debrecen, Hungary).</p>

            <p>I have been working as a <strong>software developer</strong> for more than <strong>seven years</strong> in the cheminformatical and medical fields.</p>
            <p>My favourite projects were visualizing large datasets (volumetric data). 
                It thrills me how much more we can understand data in a properly visualized way comparing to the raw format.                
            </p>
