            <p>Hello! My name is Judit and I have <strong>nine years</strong> of experience in software development. <br>
                I have an MSc degree in Computer Science (University of Debrecen, Hungary).</p>

            <p>During my career I worked as a <strong>software developer</strong> for more than <strong>seven years</strong> in the cheminformatical and medical fields.
            <br>My favourite projects were visualizing large datasets (volumetric data). 
                It thrills me how much more we can understand data in a properly visualized way comparing to the raw format.                
            </p>
            <p>I also performed in the <strong>Scrum Master</strong> role for <strong>two years</strong>.                  
                In this role I have experienced how visual representations of information can transform raw data into actionable insights, 
                empowering teams to improve their efficiency, productivity and collaboration.
            </p>
            <p>These experiences have sparked my enthusiasm for data analysis and visualization and I'm excited to continue exploring this field.</p>
